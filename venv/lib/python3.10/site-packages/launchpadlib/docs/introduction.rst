launchpadlib
************

launchpadlib is the standalone Python language bindings to Launchpad's web
services API.  It is officially supported by Canonical, although third party
packages may be available to provide bindings to other programming languages.

Set up
======

launchpadlib writes to $HOME, so isolate ourselves.

    >>> from fixtures import (
    ...     EnvironmentVariable,
    ...     TempDir,
    ...     )
    >>> tempdir_fixture = TempDir()
    >>> tempdir_fixture.setUp()
    >>> home_fixture = EnvironmentVariable('HOME', tempdir_fixture.path)
    >>> home_fixture.setUp()

OAuth authentication
====================

The Launchpad API requires user authentication via OAuth, and launchpadlib
provides a high level interface to OAuth for the most common use cases.
Several pieces of information are necessary to complete the OAuth request:

 * A consumer key, which is unique to the application using the API
 * An access token, which represents the user to the web service
 * An access token secret, essentially a password for the token

Consumer keys are hard-baked into the application.  They are generated by the
application developer and registered with Launchpad independently of the use
of the application.  Since consumer keys are arbitrary, a registered consumer
key can be paired with a secret, but most open source applications will forgo
this since it's not really a secret anyway.

The access token cannot be provided directly.  Instead, the application
generates an unauthenticated request token, exchanging this for an access
token and a secret after obtaining approval to do so from the user.  This
permission is typically gained by redirecting the user through their trusted
web browser, then back to the application.

This entire exchange is managed by launchpadlib's credentials classes.
Credentials can be stored in a file, though the security of this depends on
the implementation of the file object.  In the simplest case, the application
will request a new access token every time.

    >>> from launchpadlib.credentials import Consumer
    >>> consumer = Consumer('launchpad-library')
    >>> consumer.key
    'launchpad-library'
    >>> consumer.secret
    ''

Salgado has full access to the Launchpad API.  Out of band, the application
itself obtains Salgado's approval to access the Launchpad API on his behalf.
How the application does this is up to the application, provided it conforms
to the OAuth protocol.  Once this happens, we have Salgado's credentials for
accessing Launchpad.

    >>> from launchpadlib.credentials import AccessToken
    >>> access_token = AccessToken('salgado-change-anything', 'test')

And now these credentials are used to access the root service on Salgado's
behalf.

    >>> from launchpadlib.credentials import Credentials
    >>> credentials = Credentials(
    ...     consumer_name=consumer.key, consumer_secret=consumer.secret,
    ...     access_token=access_token)

    >>> from launchpadlib.testing.helpers import (
    ...     TestableLaunchpad as Launchpad)
    >>> launchpad = Launchpad(credentials=credentials)
    >>> sorted(launchpad.people)
    [...]
    >>> sorted(launchpad.bugs)
    [...]

If available, the Gnome keyring or KDE wallet will be used to store access
tokens.  If a keyring/wallet is not available, the application can store the
credentials on the file system, so that the next time Salgado interacts with
the application, he won't have to go through the whole OAuth request dance.

    >>> import os
    >>> import tempfile
    >>> fd, path = tempfile.mkstemp('.credentials')
    >>> os.close(fd)

Once Salgado's credentials are obtained for the first time, just set the
appropriate instance variables and use the save() method.

    >>> credentials.consumer = consumer
    >>> credentials.access_token = access_token
    >>> credentials_file = open(path, 'w')
    >>> credentials.save(credentials_file)
    >>> credentials_file.close()

And the credentials are perfectly valid for accessing Launchpad.

    >>> launchpad = Launchpad(credentials=credentials)
    >>> sorted(launchpad.people)
    [...]
    >>> sorted(launchpad.bugs)
    [...]

The credentials can also be retrieved from the file, so that the OAuth request
dance can be avoided.

    >>> credentials = Credentials()
    >>> credentials_file = open(path)
    >>> credentials.load(credentials_file)
    >>> credentials_file.close()
    >>> credentials.consumer.key
    'launchpad-library'
    >>> credentials.consumer.secret
    ''
    >>> credentials.access_token.key
    'salgado-change-anything'
    >>> credentials.access_token.secret
    'test'

These credentials too, are perfectly usable to access Launchpad.

    >>> launchpad = Launchpad(credentials=credentials)
    >>> sorted(launchpad.people)
    [...]
    >>> sorted(launchpad.bugs)
    [...]

The security of the stored credentials is left up to the file-like object.
Here, the application decides to use a dubious encryption algorithm to hide
Salgado's credentials.

    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> from codecs import EncodedFile
    >>> encrypted_file = StringIO()
    >>> stream = EncodedFile(encrypted_file, 'rot_13', 'ascii')
    >>> credentials.save(stream)
    >>> stream.seek(0, 0)
    >>> print ''.join(sorted(encrypted_file))
    [1]
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    npprff_frperg = grfg
    npprff_gbxra = fnytnqb-punatr-nalguvat
    pbafhzre_frperg =
    pbafhzre_xrl = ynhapucnq-yvoenel

    >>> stream.seek(0)
    >>> credentials = Credentials()
    >>> credentials.load(stream)
    >>> credentials.consumer.key
    'launchpad-library'
    >>> credentials.consumer.secret
    ''
    >>> credentials.access_token.key
    'salgado-change-anything'
    >>> credentials.access_token.secret
    'test'


Anonymous access
================

An anonymous access token doesn't authenticate any particular
user. Using it will give a client read-only access to the public parts
of the Launchpad dataset.

    >>> from launchpadlib.credentials import AnonymousAccessToken
    >>> anonymous_token = AnonymousAccessToken()

    >>> from launchpadlib.credentials import Credentials
    >>> credentials = Credentials(
    ...     consumer_name="a consumer", access_token=anonymous_token)
    >>> launchpad = Launchpad(credentials=credentials)

    >>> salgado = launchpad.people['salgado']
    >>> print salgado.display_name
    Guilherme Salgado

An anonymous client can't modify the dataset, or read any data that's
permission-controlled or scoped to a particular user.

    >>> launchpad.me
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized
    ...

    >>> salgado.display_name = "This won't work."
    >>> salgado.lp_save()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized
    ...

Convenience
===========

When you want anonymous access, a convenience method is available for
setting up a web service connection in one function call. All you have
to provide is the consumer name.

    >>> launchpad = Launchpad.login_anonymously(
    ...     'launchpad-library', service_root="test_dev")
    >>> sorted(launchpad.people)
    [...]

    >>> launchpad.me
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized
    ...

Otherwise, the application should obtain authorization from the user
and get a new set of credentials directly from
Launchpad.

Unfortunately, we can't test this entire process because it requires
opening up a web browser, but we can test the first step, which is to
get a request token.

    >>> import launchpadlib.credentials
    >>> credentials = Credentials('consumer')

    >>> authorization_url = credentials.get_request_token(
    ...     context='firefox', web_root='test_dev')
    >>> print(authorization_url)
    http://launchpad.test:8085/+authorize-token?oauth_token=...&lp.context=firefox

We use 'test_dev' as a shorthand for the root URL of the Launchpad
installation. It's defined in the 'uris' module as
'http://launchpad.test:8085/', and the launchpadlib code knows how to
dereference it before using it as a URL.

Information about the request token is kept in the _request_token
attribute of the Credentials object.

    >>> credentials._request_token.key is not None
    True
    >>> credentials._request_token.secret is not None
    True
    >>> print credentials._request_token.context
    firefox

Now the user must authorize that token, and this is the part we can't
test--it requires opening a web browser. Once the token is authorized
on the server side, we can call exchange_request_token_for_access_token()
on our Credentials object, which will then be ready to use.

The dictionary request token
============================

By default, get_request_token returns the URL that the user needs to
use when granting access to the token. But you can specify a different
token_format and get a dictionary instead.

    >>> credentials = Credentials('consumer')
    >>> dictionary = credentials.get_request_token(
    ...     context='firefox', web_root='test_dev',
    ...     token_format=Credentials.DICT_TOKEN_FORMAT)

The dictionary has useful information about the token and about the
levels of authentication Launchpad offers.

    >>> for param in sorted(dictionary.keys()):
    ...     print(param)
    access_levels
    lp.context
    oauth_token
    oauth_token_consumer
    oauth_token_secret

The _request_token attribute of the Credentials object has the same
fields set as if you had asked for the default URI token format.

    >>> credentials._request_token.key is not None
    True
    >>> credentials._request_token.secret is not None
    True
    >>> print credentials._request_token.context
    firefox


Credentials file errors
=======================

If the credentials file is empty, loading it raises an exception.

    >>> credentials = Credentials()
    >>> credentials.load(StringIO())
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CredentialsFileError: No configuration for version 1

It is an error to save a credentials file when no consumer or access token is
available.

    >>> credentials.consumer = None
    >>> credentials.save(StringIO())
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CredentialsFileError: No consumer

    >>> credentials.consumer = consumer
    >>> credentials.access_token = None
    >>> credentials.save(StringIO())
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CredentialsFileError: No access token

The credentials file is not intended to be edited, but because it's human
readable, that's of course possible.  If the credentials file gets corrupted,
an error is raised.

    >>> credentials_file = StringIO("""\
    ... [1]
    ... #consumer_key: aardvark
    ... consumer_secret: badger
    ... access_token: caribou
    ... access_secret: dingo
    ... """)
    >>> credentials.load(credentials_file)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NoOptionError: No option 'consumer_key' in section: '1'

    >>> credentials_file = StringIO("""\
    ... [1]
    ... consumer_key: aardvark
    ... #consumer_secret: badger
    ... access_token: caribou
    ... access_secret: dingo
    ... """)
    >>> credentials.load(credentials_file)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NoOptionError: No option 'consumer_secret' in section: '1'

    >>> credentials_file = StringIO("""\
    ... [1]
    ... consumer_key: aardvark
    ... consumer_secret: badger
    ... #access_token: caribou
    ... access_secret: dingo
    ... """)
    >>> credentials.load(credentials_file)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NoOptionError: No option 'access_token' in section: '1'

    >>> credentials_file = StringIO("""\
    ... [1]
    ... consumer_key: aardvark
    ... consumer_secret: badger
    ... access_token: caribou
    ... #access_secret: dingo
    ... """)
    >>> credentials.load(credentials_file)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NoOptionError: No option 'access_secret' in section: '1'


Bad credentials
===============

The application is not allowed to access Launchpad with a bad access token.

    >>> access_token = AccessToken('bad', 'no-secret')
    >>> credentials = Credentials(
    ...     consumer_name=consumer.key, consumer_secret=consumer.secret,
    ...     access_token=access_token)
    >>> launchpad = Launchpad(credentials=credentials)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized
    ...

The application is not allowed to access Launchpad with a consumer
name that doesn't match the credentials.

    >>> access_token = AccessToken('salgado-change-anything', 'test')
    >>> credentials = Credentials(
    ...     consumer_name='not-the-launchpad-library',
    ...     access_token=access_token)
    >>> launchpad = Launchpad(credentials=credentials)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized
    ...

The application is not allowed to access Launchpad with a bad access secret.

    >>> access_token = AccessToken('hgm2VK35vXD6rLg5pxWw', 'bad-secret')
    >>> credentials = Credentials(
    ...     consumer_name=consumer.key, consumer_secret=consumer.secret,
    ...     access_token=access_token)
    >>> launchpad = Launchpad(credentials=credentials)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized
    ...
